# transfer-learning-with-pytorch
Transfer Learning project from Udacity AI proramming with python


PROJECT DISCRIPTION

You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application.

It runs usin batch command in the command line window

to run this application use the .sh file

you can change parameters from the .sh file in training and predicting imaes
